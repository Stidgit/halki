Halki is my first rendition of a split keyboard. The initial concept came from my previous project [Tukki](https://github.com/Stidgit/tukki)

The projects aim was to make a fun yet usable split keyboard while retaining the affordability. The design choices reflect that. The plate and PCB are made to fit under the 100mm x 100mm size and also include mirrored design for cheap ordering within small MOQ.

# Firmware
- Firmware will be released when ready. The pcb is still in testing.
